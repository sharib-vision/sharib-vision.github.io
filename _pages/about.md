Hi, 

I am a computational scientist with a **doctoral and Master's degree in computer vision and image analysis**. My research is mostly focused on algorithm development for analysis and interpretation of medical and biomedical data. I have an extensive experience in building cutting edge computer vision technologies in object detection, semantic segmentation, image restoration, depth estimation, optical flow, image registration and 3D reconstruction. I have developed tools in these topics with both classical mathematical models and deep learning models. I am a passionate researcher with knowledge, energy and enthusiasm to contribute towards healthcare technologies that can benefit patients and assist clinicians around the world. I am a promotor of translational research and equality. I am a flexible, considerate and humble human being.  

​
I am currently a **senior post-doctoral researcher** at the [Department of Engineering Sciencee](https://eng.ox.ac.uk), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). My current research involves around building robust models for computer assisted endoscopy in gastroenterology, especially the oesophagus and the colon. The project is a part of NIHR Oxford biomedical research centre imaging theme on Computer aided endoscopy for Barrett's oesophagus, a defined cancer precursor in the oesophagus for which I am collaborating with consultant gastroenterologists from the [Oxford University Hospitals](https://www.ouh.nhs.uk). At Oxford, I am also co-mentoring two DPhil students together with [Prof. Jens Rittscher](https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/team/jens-rittscher). 

I am also working on developing novel deep learning methods for polyp detection and segmentation on tackling issues such as generalisability, minature networks and networks capable of dealing with small size data. To accomplish this, I am collaborating with [Pål Halvorsen from the Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway](https://www.simula.no/people/paalh), and senior consultant [Thomas de Lange from Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg, Sweden](http://www.sahlgrenskaic.com/medical-care/sahlgrenska-university-hospital/). I am mentoring some students as part of this collaboration. I am also co-supervision one PhD student with [Golberto Ochoa Ruiz](https://gda.itesm.mx/faculty/en/professors/gilberto-ochoa-ruiz) in surgical computer vision.

I have worked as researcher in different capacities in leading research teams in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. I am initiator and lead organiser of series of endoscopic computer vision challenge that started in 2019 ([follow-us here](https://twitter.com/cv_endo)). I am very thankful to all the collaborators for believing in me and assisting me in data collection, curation, and participating in discussions for planning and execution. I am keen towards learning about new technologies and open to meeting new people, establishing interesting and innovative collaborations (both academia and industry), mentoring students and looking forward for new and exciting opportunities. 

Thanks to all colleagues at Oxford who has been always supportive of me and helped me grow. I am very thankful and lucky to have also received constant support from many other researchers especially [Prof. Danial Stoyanov](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/surgical-robot-vision/people/danail-stoyanov), [Lena Maier-Hein](https://www.dkfz.de/en/cami/team/people/Lena_Maier-Hein.html) and [Adrien Bartoli](http://igt.ip.uca.fr/~ab/).

**Post-doctoral Researcher @dkfz.de**
*2015 - 2018*
​
I joined [Biomedical and Computer vision group of Prof. Karl Rohr](http://www.bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=322) at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and [DKFZ](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html), Germany. During my work there I collaborated extensively with neuroscience researchers at Forschungszentrum, Jülich, Germany with [Prof. Katrin Amunts](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-1/EN/Amunts_Katrin.html) and [Markus Axer](https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Personen/INM/INM-1/EN/Axer_Markus.html?nn=534704). I designed mathematically plausible phyics-based deformable multi-modal image registraiton techinque that allowed for precise 3D reconstruction of *ultra high resolution (1.3mu) 2D histology brain images between CCD acquired image and high-throughput polarized light microscopy* ([more info here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918305913)).

**Research Associate - Doctoral thesis @univ-lorraine.fr**
*2012 - 2015*
​
I obtained my PhD from the [University of Lorraine](https://welcome.univ-lorraine.fr/en/) supervised by [Prof Christian Daul](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/christian.daul/?q=content/curriculum-vitae) and Prof. Walter Blondel from [CNRS - CRAN laboratory](http://www.cran.univ-lorraine.fr) at Nancy, France, where I was involved in the development of robust computer vision algorithms for monitoring bladder cancer progression by accurately creating mosaics of *endoscopic videos*. The key element in this work was to enable computer to match reliable features based on frame motion and perform mosaicking of the surface under observation. ([Thesis here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01265099/))

**Master's in computer vision - Master thesis @univ-bourgogne.fr**
*2012*

I did a master's thesis between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and Le2I, Le Creusot at the University of Bourgogne supervised by [Prof. Fabrice Meriaudeau](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabrice-Meriaudeau)) and [Thomas P Karnowski](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/thomas-p-karnowski) on "Retinal image analysis from fundus imaging". 

<!-- 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About me
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
