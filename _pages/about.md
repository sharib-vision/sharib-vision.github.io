I have over 15 years experience on working on various medical and biomedical data (mostly imaging) analysis. I have master’s degree by research in Computer Vision from University of Burgundy, France (2010-2012) with thesis on “Retinal image analysis from fundus imaging”, a collaborative project between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and Le2I, Le Creusot at the University of Bourgogne. I obtained my PhD in image analysis (awarded in 01/2016) from the University of Lorraine from CNRS - CRAN laboratory at Nancy, France. I developed robust computer vision algorithms for monitoring bladder cancer progression by accurately creating mosaics from endoscopic videos. The key element in this work was to enable computer to match reliable features based on frame motion and perform mosaicking of the surface under observation (Thesis here).

Prior to joining University of Leeds as a lecturer (assistant professor), I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Engineering Sciencee, University of Oxford from 2018 – 2022 (over 4 years). I currently hold a visiting fellow position here. I designed robust models for computer assisted endoscopy in gastroenterology, especially the oesophagus. The work resulted in several high-quality publication and patents. I led various endoscopy related project developments in close collaboration with consultant gastroenterologists from the Oxford NHS University Hospitals. I also co-supervised two DPhil students, one graduated and one working towards thesis submission. I was also appointed as a post-doctoral researcher at Biomedical and Computer vision group of Prof. Karl Rohr at the University of Heidelberg and DKFZ, Germany (2015-2018). During my work there I collaborated extensively with neuroscience researchers (led by Prof. Katrin Amunts) and physicists (led by Markus Axer) at Forschungszentrum, Jülich, Germany. I designed mathematically plausible phyics-based deformable multi-modal image registraiton techinque that allowed for precise 3D reconstruction of ultra-high resolution (1.3um) 2D histology brain images between CCD acquired image and high-throughput polarized light microscopy (more info here).

I have worked as researcher in different capacities in leading research teams in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. I am an initiator and lead organiser of series of endoscopic computer vision challenge that started in 2019 (follow-us here). Together with Prof. Adrien Bartoli and colleagues, I have intiatiated P2ILF challenge at the MICCAI 2022. I am also organising member of  a series of Workshop on Cancer Prevention, Detection and Intervention workshop at MICCAI. I am a founding member of NAAMII, Kathmandu, Nepal and holds a volunteering adjunct research scientist position to train selected students from LMIC listed countries (more info here). I have supervised several research interns and currently supervising/co-supervising PhD students on topics around artificial intelligence in medical and biomedical image analysis including 3D/2D vision-based automations and immersion technologies.
